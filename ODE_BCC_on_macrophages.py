BCC also affect macrophages, to benefit their own conditions.(promoting M2 pathways and inhibiting M1 pathway.)
1. M2 feedback loop:
BCC secrete IL-10 (we use IL-4), TGF-β, and CCL2 (MCSF for M0), PGE2 (reprogr.);
promoting M2, M2 in turns promotes BCC +++
2. M1 reprogramming:
M1 not actively killed, but prevented or reprogrammed
cytokines: IL-10, TGF-β, and PGE2 give M2-like characteristics
